[[ Note about saving a level ]]
To save a file you first must make sure you have specified a file/level name.
The file/level name can be set in the "Properties" panel (located on the top left corner of the level editor).
The file/level name text box is located at the bottom of the "Properties" panel, just above the "Apply" button.

You must first click the "Apply" button within the "Properties" panel to set the level/file name in the model.
After that, you can click the "Save Level" button on the top of the level editor. 

WARNING:  There is currently no notification about overwriting a level.  Thus, the level builder WILL overwrite any file, if you specify the
same name as a pre-existing file.
